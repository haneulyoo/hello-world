# hello-world
Just another repository made in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. 

Today is my 4th Work-From-Home (WFH) day. So far I've been doing a good job of taking care of myself and doing normal things that I usually do when I'm on campus/in lab (i.e. reading papers and thinking; maybe more thinking... I think). I decided to teach myself how to finally properly use github and use python. This is my first step, so hello world! :)
